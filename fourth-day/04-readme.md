### **What is a Linked List**

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation


### **Traversal**

When traversing a linked list, you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. We depend on the Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing. The Next property is exceptionally important because it will lead us where the next node is and allow us to extract the data appropriately.

**Traversal Big O**
The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n). This is because, at its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list.

The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1). This is because there is no additional space being used than what is already given to us with the linked list input.

**Linear data structures**

One characteristic of linked lists is that they are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. We can think of a linear data structure like a game of hopscotch: in order to get to the end of the list, we have to go through all of the items in the list in order, or sequentially. 

**Memory management**
The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines. Those of us who work with dynamically typed languages like Ruby, JavaScript, or Python don’t have to think about how much memory an array uses when we write our code on a day to day basis because there are several layers of abstraction that end up with us not having to worry about memory allocation at all.

A good rule of thumb for remember the characteristics of linked lists is this:
***a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.***
