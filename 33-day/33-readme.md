## Ethics

### ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

**Preamble**
Computing professionals' actions change the world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently supporting the public good. The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ("the Code") expresses the conscience of the profession.

The Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way. Additionally, the Code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur. The Code includes principles formulated as statements of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good is always the primary consideration. Each principle is supplemented by guidelines, which provide explanations to assist computing professionals in understanding and applying the principle.


**GENERAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES.**

1. Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
2. avoid harm
3. Be honest and trustworthy.
4. Be fair and take action not to discriminate.
5. Respect privacy.
6. Honor confidentiality.
   
**PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.**

1. Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.
2. Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice
3. Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.
4. Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
5. Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
6. Perform work only in areas of competence.
7. Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
8. Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.
9. Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.

**PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES.**

1. Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.
2. Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group.
3. Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.
4. Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code.
5. Create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals.
6. Use care when modifying or retiring systems.
7. Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society.

### ACM Ethics

**The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice**
Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice (Version 5.2) as recommended by the ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices and jointly approved by the ACM and the IEEE-CS as the standard for teaching and practicing software engineering.

**Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice (Short Version)**
PREAMBLE
The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of the abstraction; the clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.

Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:

1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.

5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.
