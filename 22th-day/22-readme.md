## Context API:

### **What is a Context?**

    Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

    In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

### **When to Use Context**

    Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.


### **API**

    const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);

Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.

The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This default value can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them. Note: passing undefined as a Provider value does not cause consuming components to use defaultValue.

    <MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>

Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.

The Provider component accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider. One Provider can be connected to many consumers. Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree.

All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Provider’s value prop changes. The propagation from Provider to its descendant consumers (including .contextType and useContext) is not subject to the shouldComponentUpdate method, so the consumer is updated even when an ancestor component skips an update.

Changes are determined by comparing the new and old values using the same algorithm as Object.is.

    <MyContext.Consumer>
    {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
    </MyContext.Consumer>

A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within a function component.

Requires a function as a child. The function receives the current context value and returns a React node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree. If there is no Provider for this context above, the value argument will be equal to the defaultValue that was passed to createContext().


### **Necessity for the Design System**

After performing an audit on how we communicate with our users, we landed with a simple system of three classes of communication, and snackbars fit perfectly on the ‘low priority’ end of that spectrum. They are small notifications that show up on the screen when a user performs an action. They are not intrusive at all and appear for just a brief moment.

**Globally Accessible**
The state of our snackbars (which ones are visible) can be localized to a single centralized component. That same centralized component can be responsible for rendering them. There’s really no need for another component somewhere in the tree to hook into that state (at least not in our use-case).

However, the management of that state (adding, removing) needs to be globally accessible.
