## Async/Await Function:

**Aynchronous** :which means that it has an event loop that allows you to queue up an action that wonâ€™t take place until the loop is available.
It simply allows us to write promises based code.

**Await**:
Await function is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within the async block only. It makes the code wait until the promise returns a result. It only makes the async block wait.

## Promises:

are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

#### Benefits of Promises 

1. Improves Code Readability
2. Better handling of asynchronous operations
3. Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
4. Better Error Handling

#### A Promise has four states: 

1. **fulfilled:** Action related to the promise succeeded
2. **rejected:** Action related to the promise failed
3. **pending:** Promise is still pending i.e. not fulfilled or rejected yet
4. **settled:** Promise has fulfilled or rejected

#### Example:
var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  const x = "geeksforgeeks";
  const y = "geeksforgeeks"
  if(x === y) {
    resolve();
  } else {
    reject();
  }
});
   
promise.
    then(function () {
        console.log('Success, You are a GEEK');
    }).
    catch(function () {
        console.log('Some error has occurred');
    });

#### Promise Consumers

Promises can be consumed by registering functions using .then and .catch methods.

1. **then()**
then() is invoked when a promise is either resolved or rejected. It may also be defined as a career which takes data from promise and further executes it successfully.

2. **catch()**
catch() is invoked when a promise is either rejected or some error has occurred in execution. It is used as an Error Handler whenever at any step there is a chance of getting an error.

## Callback Functions:

 functions are objects. we can also pass functions as parameters to other functions and call them inside the outer functions. 
    const message = function() {  
        console.log("This message is shown after 3 seconds");
        }
        setTimeout(message, 3000);

 **Anonymous Function**:
    setTimeout(function() {  
        console.log("This message is shown after 3 seconds");
    }, 3000);

**Arrow Function**:
    setTimeout(() => { 
        console.log("This message is shown after 3 seconds");
    }, 3000);
